title: How To Lose A Customer In Two Lines
date: 2009-11-13

You know, I'm not a picky customer. When I find a company that does 
the job well and without causing problems, I tend to stick with them 
for a long time. I also tend to advocate for good companies, because 
they're becoming less and less common. Today, a company just lost my 
business forever, and I doubt anyone else who sees this will ever deal 
with them either. I ordered some Adrafinil from Nubrain.com yesterday. The ordered 
was marked as completed in their site and I wasn't given a tracking 
number (didn't think about it at the time, but first class USPS was 
used, so there was no way to track it). As I was curious to see how 
long it'd take to arrive, I looked up where it was shipping from and 
found that they're located in Lawrenceville, GA, where I reside. 
Since the site didn't say it had shipped yet, I decided to send them 
an email to see if it was possible to pick up the order:

> Hello, I was looking at your site to figure out where my order (redacted) was going to ship from, to get some idea of the time it'd take to ship, when I found that you're located in Lawrenceville as well. If my order hasn't shipped yet, would it be possible to pick it up instead?
> Thanks,

Not a terribly difficult request. If the answer was no, or it had 
already shipped, I would've thought nothing of it and moved on. 
Instead, I got this:

> WE ONLY SEND BY US MAIL IF YOU WANT PICK UP CALL PAPA JOHNS PIZZA

Is it really that much of an inconvenience to send back "Sorry, but 
our store only delivers"? When you're in a market like shipping 
pharmaceuticals, a certain amount of trust is required, not that this 
would be appropriate in any market. If you want to keep your customers, you have to treat them well, not 
like you're being inconvenienced by them. If you don't want to do the 
job, don't do it; don't act like the customer is doing you a 
disservice by giving you money.
