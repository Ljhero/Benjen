title: Demo a week, week 1: Waveride
date: 2010-03-25

For a long time, I've sat on the sidelines of the [demoscene][1], generally watching in awe as ASD, Farbrausch, Conspiracy, and others produce amazing works of art. I recently decided that I'd jump in and see what I can do, and to accomplish that I've decided to start releasing a demo a week. My goal is to get my feet wet and learn how to actually build something beautiful.

Today I'm releasing my very first real demo ever, [Waveride][2], which I decided to hack together over the course of the last few hours. There's not much to it -- a wave plane consisting of spheres and droplets falling onto it with locations based on the music data -- but I don't think it's bad for a first shot. I'm planning on improving it over the coming weeks, before moving on to something new. At the moment, it's Windows-only, but pure OpenGL -- it should work fine in Wine. I'm going to port it to OS X and Linux before moving on.

Anyway, here's a link if you want to check it out in its current incarnation: . I've already received a good bit of information on what I need to fix (the nauseating rotation is absolutely first up on the list, I swear!), but please give me anything you can think of. This is an experiment for growth, and I can't grow if I don't know what I need to improve upon. The NFO is below.

Happy Hacking,

    Welp, not much to say.  I said I was going to create a demo a week until I had
    a clue what I was doing.  Waveride is the first of these demos, and I'm pretty 
    damn proud of it.  It's not perfect, and I'm not terribly happy with having 
    used an off-the-shelf song for it, but eh.
    
    Decided to sit down and write a demo, and I did it.  That was 1am, this is 8am.
    Can't complain too much.
    
    Developed and designed by Daeken.
    Music is Miriel by Nightbeat (I believe this is cool -- if not, please, please 
    let me know, and I'll change it at once.)
    
    Greets to:
    Nightbeat
    ASD
    SVatG
    Lateralus
    Kewlers
    
    Until next time,
