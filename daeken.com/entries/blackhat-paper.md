title: Blackhat paper
date: 2012-07-24

Well, my talk for Blackhat (My Arduino can beat up your hotel room lock) is over.  Things could've gone better in terms of execution -- went through it too quickly and ended up using 30 minutes of my 60 minute slot.  But people really enjoyed it and I spent a good hour or so answering questions.

Now it's time to release everything. There's still work to be done on the paper, but that will happen in time.

I'll write more on all this in the near future, but now it's time for sleep and all that.

Happy hacking,

Edit #1: I've created an IRC channel for the ongoing research in this stuff.  It's #lockresearch on irc.freenode.net.  Feel free to join if you want to keep track of the work, or participate hands on.
