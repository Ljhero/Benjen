title: Emokit status, JsDataFlowEditor, and looking for work
date: 2010-09-25

Before discussing new stuff, a little update on the progress of [Emokit][1]. Emokit is now completely able to parse the EEG data coming from the Consumer and Developer headsets, and thanks to skadge now contains proper Linux support, the beginnings of a C library, and quite a few other fun features. At this point, the only things left to reverse-engineer are the battery meter and contact qualities. Huge thanks to everyone who's supported us -- it's been invaluable!

Now for new stuff. I've just released [JsDataFlowEditor][2], a Javascript library (based on Raphael and JQuery) for building and manipulating dataflow graphs. This can be tremendously useful for everything from image compositing to animations to audio work to visual programming. I'm really excited to see what people do with it. It's still fairly early stage, but it works well as it stands.

Super simple example use: . If you build something with it, shoot me an email at  and let me know -- I'll link to it from the Github repo.

On another note, I've decided to get out of the full-time startup thing for a while. If you know of anyone looking for a developer/reverse-engineer in the NYC area, shoot them a link to  please.

Happy hacking,
