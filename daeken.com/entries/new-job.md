After a lot of interviewing and a lot of deliberation, I decided to take a job. Starting Monday, I'm the new senior security analyst for [Matasano Security][1]. I'm really looking forward to working with these guys, and I hope to post some fun stuff on the [Chargen][2] soon!

Thanks to everyone who contacted me in response to my post about looking for work -- there were a lot of interesting options, and it took a while to narrow it down.

Happy hacking,
